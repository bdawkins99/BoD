Convergence to Gaussian occurs rapidly with increasing $p$, and Gaussian is a good approximation for $p$ as low as $10$ attributes. The number of attributes in bioinformatics data is typically much larger, at least on the order of $10^3$. The Euclidean metric has stronger convergence to normal than Manhattan.

The average MAF was set to 0.205 for all simulations. Convergence to Gaussian occurs more gradually with increasing $p$ than in continuous data. Significant convergence seems to occur when $p \geq 1000$, however, this is actually a relatively small number of features in the context of GWAS. Considering a realistic number of features for GWAS, the normality assumption of GM distances holds. This metric has the slowest convergence to Gaussian among all we have considered. P values from Shapiro-Wilk test, where the null hypothesis is a Gaussian distribution.}

Significant convergence seems to occur when $p \geq 1000$, however, this is actually a relatively small number of features in the context of GWAS. Considering a realistic number of features for GWAS, the normality assumption of AM distances holds. This metric has the slightly faster convergence to Gaussian than the GM metric, which is probably due to the fact that the AM metric has one more value in its range (e.g., 1/2). P values from Shapiro-Wilk test, where the null hypothesis is a Gaussian distribution.}

Considering a realistic number of features for GWAS, the normality assumption of TiTv distances holds. This metric has the significantly faster convergence to Gaussian than the AM metric, which is probably due to the fact that the TiTv metric contains 2 more values in its range (e.g., 1/4 \& 3/4).

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{central_limit_hist_rs-fMRI_standard.pdf}
	\caption{Convergence to Gaussian for rs-fMRI distances for simulated correlation matrices with $m=100$ instances and $p=10, 50, 150,$ and $300$ attributes (or ROIs). Correlation matrices were generated for each instance from random normal $m \times p$ data matrices. Each correlation matrix was then stretched out into a long vector, Fisher r-to-z transformed, stored in a $p(p-1) \times m$ matrix, and standardized so that the $m$ columns are mean 0 and unit variance. Convergence to Gaussian occurs very rapidly for this data because the dimensions are larger than a typical $m \times p$ data set. The large attribute dimension $p(p-1)$ means that there are significantly more terms in each sum to compute pairwise distances. Therefore, Classical Central Limit Theorem dictates that distances in this context will be closer to Gaussian. P values from Shapiro-Wilk test, where the null hypothesis is a Gaussian distribution.}

Each correlation matrix was then stretched out into a long vector, Fisher r-to-z transformed, stored in a $p(p-1) \times m$ matrix, and standardized so that the $m$ columns are mean 0 and unit variance. Convergence to Gaussian occurs approximately as rapidly as the standard rs-fMRI metric. Just as in the standard rs-fMRI metric, the large attribute dimension $p(p-1)$ means that there are significantly more terms in each sum to compute pairwise distances.

The variation in sample standard deviation of Euclidean distance is quite small, so each simulated moment is clustered about 1.}
