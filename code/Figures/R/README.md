Some organization:

- `util_funcs.R` include functions to make figures 6-8 and compute means and sds for fig 9, 10.
- `refigs_null_corr.Rmd` simulates data and plots density curves of distance distributations generated from correlated and uncorrelated transformed data for three kinds of distances: Euclidean, Ti/Tv and rs-fMRI.
- `re_figs_titv_maf.Rmd` plots the distribution changes (Mean Â± SD) with respect to Ti/Tv and MAF.
